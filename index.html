            <h1>Bipan</h1>
            <p>A recent Bachelor of Cyber Security graduate from Deakin University with a strong foundation in networking, penetration testing, and offensive security. I have hands-on experience in Web Application and Active Directory penetration testing, gained through platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, where I have explored various real-world attack vectors and security misconfigurations.

                I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, C++, and C#, which I leverage for automation, exploit development, and security tool creation. My passion for cybersecurity drives me to continuously expand my skill set through CTF challenges, research, and practical labs.
                
                Currently, I am pursuing industry-recognized certifications such as Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) and Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) to further solidify my expertise in ethical hacking, red teaming, and advanced penetration testing methodologies. My commitment to continuous learning and hands-on practice ensures that I stay up to date with the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and security techniques in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.</p>
