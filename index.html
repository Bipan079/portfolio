            <h1>Jesvin</h1>
            <p>A recent Bachelor of Cyber Security graduate from Deakin University with a strong foundation in networking, penetration testing, and offensive security. I have hands-on experience in Web Application and Active Directory penetration testing, gained through platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, where I have explored various real-world attack vectors and security misconfigurations.

                I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, C++, and C#, which I leverage for automation, exploit development, and security tool creation. My passion for cybersecurity drives me to continuously expand my skill set through CTF challenges, research, and practical labs.
                
                Currently, I am pursuing industry-recognized certifications such as Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) and Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) to further solidify my expertise in ethical hacking, red teaming, and advanced penetration testing methodologies. My commitment to continuous learning and hands-on practice ensures that I stay up to date with the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and security techniques in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
        <p>I developed a personal website to showcase my portfolio and projects, focusing on creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            Additionally, I learned how to structure content effectively, implement interactive elements, and ensure cross-browser compatibility. This project helped me understand the importance of UI/UX principles and reinforced my ability to create visually appealing and functional web applications.

        </ol>
        <h3>Hack The Box Machine (Work in Progress)</h3>
        <p>I am in the process of creating a Hack The Box machine designed to challenge players with realistic security vulnerabilities. This project involves configuring a virtual environment, setting up intentional misconfigurations, and designing exploit paths to test various penetration testing techniques. Through this, I am improving my skills in system administration, vulnerability research, privilege escalation, and exploit development while gaining hands-on experience with Linux, Windows, and security tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite."
